# python_microgame
a python microgame created with python 2.6 and pygame

After entering the python_microgame directory, running python main.py in the terminal will launch the game.

It is a simple game of evading the obstacles, created with pygame.

The game was originally created on a Windows machine. For some reason, pygame seems not to be compatible with OS X El Capitan
therefore cannot be run on machines running operating system OS X El Capitan. Machines running Windows or OS X Yosemite(10.10 or below) should be able to run the program.
